Difference to version from Ac3s:
 - more intuitiv keys: Numpad + or - for one step faster/slower. Shift and + or - for much faster/slower. numpad 0 to go back to normal speed.
 - Allowing to change speed also while on Worldmap/Menu/Pause/PopUp
 - Hiding the "change keybind" in the menu (because the game is unable to remember these settings anyway after the game was restarted..)
 - Play an Audio and show a nice notification for all players, when the gamespeed was changed
 - On leaving the game, the Speed is reset to 1, if it was below 1, because otherwise the game will freeze.

1.01:
- added narrator speach to the notifications
1.02:
- added code to reduce the gamespeed to 1 again when leaving the game, if it is below 1. otherwise the game will freeze.
